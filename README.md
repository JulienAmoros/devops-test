# Why docker?
Docker is a simple way to deploy an application locally, without having to take care of
service and library dependencies (which may sometime be quite a pain, let's admit)
For more informations, see in folder `.docker`.

NB: Project is configured in a way that you're still able to install dependencies by your own (if
you want to test with `rails test` or start development environment with `rails s`),
to do that, copy `.env.default` file, rename it as `.env`, and fill it with proper informations.

# Why Ansible?

# Why Capistrano?

# Why Gitlab-CI?
